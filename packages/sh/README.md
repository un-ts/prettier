> An opinionated `shellscript` formatter plugin for [Prettier][], also support simple format of `Dockerfile`, `properties`, `gitignore`, `dotenv`, `hosts`, `jvmoptions`...

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing, taking various rules into account.

This plugin adds support for various file formats through [mvdan-sh][] via [sh-syntax][] and [dockerfmt][].

## Notice

This plugin is still under development, its printer just wraps [mvdan-sh][]'s default printer with powered by [sh-syntax][].
Of course it should just work, but may not match [prettier][]'s format sometimes.

> [!WARNING]
>
> `ignore` files are not officially supported by [mvdan-sh][] what means only basic and simple `ignore` usage cases can be handled correctly.
> We cannot do much on our side. See also <https://github.com/un-ts/prettier/issues/336>.

## Requirements

`prettier-plugin-sh` is an evergreen module. ðŸŒ² This module requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v16.0.0+).

## Install

Using npm:

```sh
# npm
npm i -D prettier prettier-plugin-sh

# yarn
yarn add -D prettier prettier-plugin-sh
```

## Usage

Once installed, [Prettier plugins](https://prettier.io/docs/en/plugins.html) must be added to `.prettierrc`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["prettier-plugin-sh"]
}
```

Then:

```sh
# npx
npx prettier --write script.sh

# yarn
yarn prettier --write script.sh
```

## Parser Options

```ts
interface ShOptions {
  // parser
  /**
   * KeepComments makes the parser parse comments and attach them to
   * nodes, as opposed to discarding them.
   */
  keepComments?: boolean
  /**
   * LangVariant describes a shell language variant to use when tokenizing and
   * parsing shell code. The zero value is [LangBash].
   */
  variant?: LangVariant
  /**
   * StopAt configures the lexer to stop at an arbitrary word, treating it
   * as if it were the end of the input. It can contain any characters
   * except whitespace, and cannot be over four bytes in size.
   *
   * This can be useful to embed shell code within another language, as
   * one can use a special word to mark the delimiters between the two.
   *
   * As a word, it will only apply when following whitespace or a
   * separating token. For example, StopAt("$$") will act on the inputs
   * "foo $$" and "foo;$$", but not on "foo '$$'".
   *
   * The match is done by prefix, so the example above will also act on
   * "foo $$bar".
   */
  stopAt?: string
  /**
   *  RecoverErrors allows the parser to skip up to a maximum number of
   *  errors in the given input on a best-effort basis.
   *  This can be useful to tab-complete an interactive shell prompt,
   *  or when providing diagnostics on slightly incomplete shell source.
   *
   *  Currently, this only helps with mandatory tokens from the shell grammar
   *  which are not present in the input. They result in position fields
   *  or nodes whose position report [Pos.IsRecovered] as true.
   *
   *  For example, given the input
   *
   * 	(foo |
   *
   *  the result will contain two recovered positions; first, the pipe requires
   *  a statement to follow, and as [Stmt.Pos] reports, the entire node is recovered.
   *  Second, the subshell needs to be closed, so [Subshell.Rparen] is recovered.
